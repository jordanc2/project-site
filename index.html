				Twin brothers Kent & Kevin Smotherman founded TwinFeats Software in 1983 with a simple premise:
				Free software for a free world. From the beginnings on the Commodore 64 to today's Android apps, that
				vision has never wavered.

			<h1>Services</h1>
			TwinFeats Software creates innovative, custom web applications which will meet and exceed expectations.
			We will work with you to fully understand your needs, but more than that - your data. Web applications are
			all about data, and without deeply understanding the needs of your data, your web application will suffer.
			<h2>Web application? Huh?</h2>
			Web sites are static. The content they display doesn't change dynamically. A web applications is a web site
			powered by a database. Facebook is a great example of a web application - the data shown varies by user and
			can change every single second.

			<h1>Applications</h1>
			We've written so many applications in the last 35+ years that we have literally lost count! Applications
			like our FreedomWare line of games for the Commodore 64 are long gone, as are our productivity suite for
			GEOS on the C64 and Amiga.
			<p>
				Ever use WebEx, GotoMeeting, or Zoom teleconferencing software? We wrote our own back in the 90s for not
				just conferencing, but online learning. Our Android applications range from custom games to productivity
				tools. Web sites and web applications? We've done 'em by the dozens. 
			</p>
			<p>
				As we like to say, if we can't do it at TwinFeats Software, its a hardware problem!
